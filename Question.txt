Dynamically Generated Content with JavaScript (2 hours)
Create a web page that dynamically generates content using JavaScript. 
The page should include a button that, when clicked, 
generates a new random number and displays it on the page. 
Use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) 
to add and remove elements.
